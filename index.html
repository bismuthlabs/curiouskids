          Let’s suppose you were an astronaut who just landed on the planet
          Mars. What would you need to survive?
        </p>
        <p>
          For starters, here’s a short list: Water, food, shelter – and oxygen.
        </p>
        <p>
          Oxygen is in the air we breathe here on Earth. Plants and some kinds
          of bacteria provide it for us.
        </p>
        <p>
          But oxygen is not the only gas in the Earth’s atmosphere. It’s not
          even the most abundant. In fact, only 21% of our air is made up of
          oxygen. Almost all the rest is nitrogen – about 78%.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now you might be wondering: If there’s more nitrogen in the air, why
          do we breathe oxygen?
        </p>
        <p>
          Here’s how it works: Technically, when you breathe in, you take in
          everything that’s in the atmosphere. But your body uses only the
          oxygen; you get rid of the rest when you exhale.
        </p>
        <h2>The air on Mars</h2>
        <p>
          The Martian atmosphere is thin – its volume is only 1% of the Earth’s
          atmosphere. To put it another way, there’s 99% less air on Mars than
          on Earth.
        </p>
        <p>
          That’s partly because Mars is about half the size of Earth. Its
          gravity isn’t strong enough to keep atmospheric gases from escaping
          into space.
        </p>
        <p>
          And the most abundant gas in that thin air is carbon dioxide. For
          people on Earth, that’s a poisonous gas at high concentrations.
          Fortunately, it makes up far less than 1% of our atmosphere. But on
          Mars, carbon dioxide is 96% of the air!
        </p>
        <p>
          Meanwhile, Mars has almost no oxygen; it’s only one-tenth of one
          percent of the air, not nearly enough for humans to survive.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you tried to breathe on the surface of Mars without a spacesuit
          supplying your oxygen – bad idea – you would die in an instant. You
          would suffocate, and because of the low atmospheric pressure, your
          blood would boil, both at about the same time.
        </p>
        <h2>Life without oxygen</h2>
        <p>
          So far, researchers have not found any evidence of life on Mars. But
          the search is just beginning; our robotic probes have barely scratched
          the surface.
        </p>
        <p>
          Without question, Mars is an extreme environment. And it’s not just
          the air. Very little liquid water is on the Martian surface.
          Temperatures are incredibly cold – at night, it’s more than -100
          degrees Fahrenheit (-73 degrees Celsius).
        </p>
        <p>
          But plenty of organisms on Earth survive extreme environments. Life
          has been found in the Antarctic ice, at the bottom of the ocean and
          miles below the Earth’s surface. Many of those places have extremely
          hot or cold temperatures, almost no water and little to no oxygen.
        </p>
        <p>
          And even if life no longer exists on Mars, maybe it did billions of
          years ago, when it had a thicker atmosphere, more oxygen, warmer
          temperatures and significant amounts of liquid water on the surface.
        </p>
        <p>
          That’s one of the goals of NASA’s Mars Perseverance rover mission – to
          look for signs of ancient Martian life. That’s why Perseverance is
          searching within the Martian rocks for fossils of organisms that once
          lived – most likely, primitive life, like Martian microbes.
        </p>
        <h2>Do-it-yourself oxygen</h2>
        <p>
          Among the seven instruments on board the Perseverance rover is MOXIE,
          an incredible device that takes carbon dioxide out of the Martian
          atmosphere and turns it into oxygen.
        </p>
        <p>
          If MOXIE works the way that scientists hope it will, future astronauts
          will not only make their own oxygen; they could use it as a component
          in the rocket fuel they’ll need to fly back to Earth. The more oxygen
          people are able to make on Mars, the less they’ll need to bring from
          Earth – and the easier it becomes for visitors to go there. But even
          with “homegrown” oxygen, astronauts will still need a spacesuit.
        </p>
        <p>
          Right now, NASA is working on the new technologies needed to send
          humans to Mars. That could happen in the next decade, perhaps sometime
          during the late 2030s. By then, you’ll be an adult – and maybe one of
          the first to take a step on Mars.
